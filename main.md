# Introduction

Greetings, dear readers.

"Unofficial History of WoC" - one would ask the purpose behind this book. Why should one care about a small, close-knit Discord server about coding? Why should I write this book? The answer to these questions will be revealed as you read on.

This server is not just any Discord server—it is a palace of memories, friends, fun, and jokes. Its culture and traditions are unlike any other. My main goal in writing this book is to preserve these memories, traditions, and moments so that, decades from now, we can still look back and remember the fun we had.

In this book, you will come across terms such as "swololo," "delulu," or "panini." Rest assured, their meanings will become clear soon enough. Additionally, some notable figures who shaped the server include: Verq, Disassembled, MTF Alpha 1 and its alts, Dragon and its alts, Jack Ma and its alts, Swololo, Tony Stark, Rolfan and many more.
This book is not just for the sake of reading but for the sake of remembrance.

Moreover, this is from the “citizen’s perspective”. We do not know the struggles of countless mods and admins who protect this community for whom they are responsible for and care for.

I am just a newcomer, passing by, seeing the fun they had- no, they fun WE had. This server is over 4 years old, and the incidents that will mainly be recounted are only over 2 years old or younger. Please forgive me if any error occurs, I hereby accept all responsibility for this memorial.

Before we begin, let us get familiar with some of our members.

## Verq

The admin who wishes to marry Rust.

## Disassembled

The admin who everyone fears. The mere mention of his name sends shivers down the spine of newcomers!

## MTF Alpha-1 (“Red Right Hand”)

Ah, the infamous SCP Foundation personnel. A warrior against brainrot, a shadow in the server’s history, and perhaps its greatest enigma. Alpha was once among the most active members, even achieving a legendary milestone—over 15,000 messages in a single month, a record untouched by mere mortals.

But with great activity comes great… exile. Alpha was no stranger to controversy, amassing an army of alt accounts—some say more than 10, though the true number may never be known. Over half of them met their untimely demise at the hands of the banhammer, yet whispers persist…
Alpha is still here. Watching. Waiting. Lurking in the depths of the server, prepared to strike at the first sign of degeneracy. When the server teeters on the brink of chaos, when brainrot spreads unchecked, fear not—for MTF Alpha-1 still stands guard. He is known by many names, including but not limited to: Hopeless Child, Angel of Death, Main Battle Tank, Putin’s son in law and many more. 
Jack ma - Also called “CEO of Dina” is the user which started a revolution in modern WoC. 

Lemons - #LemonsTheHottie, a legend (or lemon) in his own right, known for his charm, wit, and the undeniable fact that he’s just built different.

## Owen

Chill server owner. Perhaps the only truly sane one here. Reports also includes that he lives in a british army base. Obsessed with tea and bri’ishness

## Sloppy

The most degenerate, goofy, uncool, ugly person in this server. Recommended do not talk to him. Very nice cat that says “sup”.

## Kanata

WoC’s chill guy who loves katanas. A true connoisseur of the blade. Cross him, and, well… let’s just say no one has lived to tell the tale.

## Mnem

“If it compiles, it ships”. This user denies allegations of having posted this quote. Has made an odd flag for MTF alpha.
