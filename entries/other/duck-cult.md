# The duck cult

![Is a cult](https://badgen.net/static/type/cult)

The duck cult is an important aspect of the server's legacy. It is a cult created
by "Duckie | Duck Cult Leader", an ambitious duck that aims to defend duck's rights
against the wild, barbarian and uneducated humans who violate them. And also geese.
And some birds.

Members include nameunknown, duckie, evil, and many others, many of which are active
and help spread the message of the duck cult.
